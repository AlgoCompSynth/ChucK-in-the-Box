# Introduction {.unnumbered}

I have always been fascinated by the two extremes in computing: the very large and the very small. I've worked with computers as large as 1980s scientific supercomputers and as small as the Raspberry Pi Pico.

*ChucK-in-the-Box* resides on a small computer - the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. This \$15US (2025 dollars) single-board computer isn't the smallest I've ever programmed, but it is certainly the most powerful per dollar.

The fastest computer I ever used in the 1980s had a peak speed of 341 million 64-bit floating-point operations per second in assembly language and took up as much space as two refrigerators. The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W peaks at 1.74 billion 64-bit floating-point operations per second in C. That's about five times as fast!
