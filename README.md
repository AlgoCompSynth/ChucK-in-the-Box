# ChucK-in-the-Box - Computer music development tools for Linux

## What is this?

ChucK-in-the-Box is a collection of computer music development tools
for Linux computers. ChucK-in-the-Box contains

1. The [ChucK](https://chuck.stanford.edu/)
ecosystem: ChucK, miniAudicle, ChuGins and
[ChuGL](https://chuck.stanford.edu/chugl/),
2. The [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/)
audio programming language, and
3. [FluidSynth](https://www.fluidsynth.org/)
SoundFont-based synthesis tools.

The first release is designed for use on
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) single-board computers.
A command-line version is available for the $15US
[Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/).
This board was in fact the original inspiration for ChucK-in-the-Box.

The graphical version includes the
[miniAudicle](https://audicle.cs.princeton.edu/mini/) interactive
development environment and will run on any Raspberry Pi 4 or 5
with at least 2 GB of RAM and either the latest PiOS 64-bit desktop
based on Debian `trixie` or the legacy PiOS 64-bit desktop based on
Debian `bookworm`. In addition to the host installation, Raspberry
Pi 4 or 5 users can install 
[boxed-chuck](docs/boxed-chuck.md), a [Distrobox](https://distrobox.it/)
container based on Debian `trixie` with the same software as the host version.
